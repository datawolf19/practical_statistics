    "# Design of Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Design of Experiment (\"DOE\") is to confirm or reject the null hypothesis (\"H0\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "## AB Test\n",
    "* The control is the existing treatment/method.\n",
    "* The typical hypothesis is that the _test_ is better than the _control_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Terminology\n",
    "* Treatment - something to which the subject is exposed to.\n",
    "* Treatment group - group of subjects exposed to a specific treatment.\n",
    "* Control group - group not exposed to the treatment.\n",
    "* Randomization - the process of randomly assigning the treatment to subjects.\n",
    "* Subject - the thing exposed to treatments.\n",
    "* Test statistic - the metric used to measure the effect of the treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "1. Popular in web design & marketing because they can be measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Selection\n",
    "Is used to:\n",
    "1. Test the effect of different treatments.\n",
    "2. Determine whether it was due to luck of the draw.\n",
    "* Note that the goal is to determine whether the difference is due to the treatment or chance. \n",
    "* Care should be taken when choosing the test statistic to use for comparing both groups.\n",
    "* The most common metric is binary.\n",
    " * i.e., Click v. No Click \n",
    " * This can be summarized in a 2 x 2 table"
